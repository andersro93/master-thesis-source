# A Scalable Architecture for Parallel Execution of the Tsetlin Machine Source Code

## Repo description
The contents in this repository is part of my Master Thesis: A Scalable Architecture for Parallel Execution of the Tsetlin Machine. 
Feel free to use my code or take inspiration for it. For more recent research, I would suggest you to head over to [CAIR's Github repositories](https://github.com/cair/).

## Project description
The task of my thesis was to develop a small framework that allowed the [Tsetlin Machine algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01508) to execute in parallel. This project includes some test data that can be used to verify that my proposed architecture do indeed work.
